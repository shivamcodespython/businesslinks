---

## 💡 1. Executive Summary & Core Philosophy

**BizLink** connects any enterprise—from neighborhood bakeries, beauty salons, auto mechanics, grocery marts, cafes, and fashion boutiques to wholesale depots and manufacturing plants worldwide.

It bridges:
1. **B2C (Customer to Store):** Walk-in consumers searching for nearby products, getting 1-click Google Maps directions, and tracking personal store credit.
2. **B2B (Store to Supplier):** Merchants discovering wholesale distributors, super stockists, and factory direct lines.
3. **Digital Khata Bahi (Udhaar & Jama):** Recording credit/debit transactions with customer balances and instant WhatsApp reminders.

## 🔑 4. SerpApi Configuration (Vercel & Local)

BizLink isolates all SerpApi calls within a secure backend API endpoint (`/api/search-businesses` & `src/services/serpapiService.ts`). The API key is **never exposed to client-side JavaScript**.

### Local `.env.local`:
```env
SERPAPI_KEY=your_actual_serpapi_key_here
```

### Vercel Deployment:
Add `SERPAPI_KEY` under **Project Settings > Environment Variables** and trigger a redeployment.
